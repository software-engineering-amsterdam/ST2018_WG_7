-- == Exercise 1 == --
{-
The goal of this exercise is to extend the Sudoku program described in the
lecture of this week with functions that can also handle Sudokus of a special
kind: the Sudokus that appear in the Dutch evening newspaper NRC-Handelsblad 
each week (designed by Peter Ritmeester, from Oct 8, 2005 onward). These NRC 
Sudokus are special in that they have to satisfy a few extra constraints: 
in addition to the usual Sudoku constraints, each of the 3Ã—3 subgrids with 
left-top corner (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), and (6,6) should also yield an injective 
function. The above figure gives an example (this is the NRC sudoku that appeared 
Saturday Nov 26, 2005).

Your task is to formalize this extra constraint, and to use your formalization 
in a program that can solve this Sudoku. See also the webpage of Andries Brouwer
Deliverables: modified Sudoku solver, solution to the above puzzle, indication of
time spent.
